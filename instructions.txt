Notes for future instructions
=============================

# I may provide a script to set up a new machine and add new servers
# or I may just provide instructions

# recommend using a new account and keep its capabilities low
sudo adduser minecraft
# login as minecraft and
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp minecraft@.service ~/.config/systemd/user

# servers location ENFORCED to be /home/minecraft/MinecraftServers
# also this project is REQUIRED to be cloned to /home/minecraft/minecraft-control
# if you want to change the above or use a different account name
# then edit ~/.config/systemd/user/minecraft@.service
# NOTE that after changing  ~/.config/systemd/user/minecraft@.service you need
systemctl --user  daemon-reload

# COPY as many minecraft servers as you fancy to
# /home/minecraft/MinecraftServers one subfolder per server
# each to contain at a minimum server.jar and eula.txt
# but also may contain multiple world folders
#
# place a copy of start_server in each server root folder
# edit start_server if you want different memory config for a given instance

# make sure the user is allowed to run services
sudo loginctl enable-linger minecraft
# but if that fails then:
sudo touch /var/lib/systemd/linger/minecraft

# prerequisites
you will need pipenv https://github.com/pypa/pipenv and python 3.7 or greater
pip3 install --user pipenv
(then make sure ~/.local/bin is in the path - this is where pipenv will go)
sudo apt install screen
sudo apt install libsystemd-dev
cd minecraft-control
pipenv install

# launch the script mc-control.py and follow the prompts
pipenv run python mc-control.py
