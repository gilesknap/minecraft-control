# minecraft-control
Some scripts for managing multiple Minecraft servers on a single machine

Inspired by https://github.com/agowa338/MinecraftSystemdUnit/ configuration for running minecraft as a systemd service.

Adds python scripts to easily see the state of any number of servers, plus configure and control them.
